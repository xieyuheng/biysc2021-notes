   * - ``exact``
     - If 
       ``P`` is the target of the current goal 
       and ``hp`` is a term of type ``P``,  
       then ``exact hp,`` will close the goal.

       Mathematically, this saying "this is *exactly* what we were required to prove".

   * - ``intro``
     - If the target of the current goal is a function ``P → Q``, 
       then ``intro hp,`` will produce a hypothesis 
       ``hp : P`` and change the target to  ``Q``.

       Mathematically, this is saying that in order to define a function from ``P`` to ``Q``,
       we first need to choose an arbitrary element of ``P``.

   * - ``have``
     - ``have`` is used to create intermediate variables. 
     
       If ``f`` is a term of type ``P → Q`` and 
       ``hp`` is a term of type ``P``, then
       ``have hq := f hp,`` creates the hypothesis ``hq : Q`` .
     
   * - ``apply``
     - ``apply`` is used for backward reasoning. 

       If the target of the current goal is ``Q`` and 
       ``f`` is a term of type ``P → Q``, then 
       ``apply f,`` changes target to ``P``.

       Mathematically, this is equivalent to saying "because ``P`` implies ``Q``, to prove ``Q`` it suffices to prove ``P``".

Proof by contradiction
========================

.. list-table:: 
  :widths: 10 90

  * - ``exfalso``
    - Changes the target of the current goal to ``false``.
      
      The name derives from `"ex falso, quodlibet" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion>`__ which translates to "from contradiction, anything". 
      You should use this tactic when there are contradictory hypotheses present. 
  
  * - ``by_cases``
    - If ``P : Prop``, then ``by_cases P,`` creates two goals, 
      the first with a hypothesis ``hp: P`` and second with a hypothesis ``hp: ¬ P``.

      Mathematically, this is saying either ``P`` is true or ``P`` is false.
      ``by_cases`` is the most direct application of the law of excluded middle.

  * - ``by_contradiction``
    - If the target of the current goal is  ``Q``,
      then ``by_contradiction,`` changes the target to  ``false`` and 
      adds ``hnq : ¬ Q`` as a hypothesis.

      Mathematically, this is proof by contradiction. 
  
  * - ``push_neg``
    - ``push_neg,`` simplifies negations in the target. 
    
      For example, if the target of the current goal is ``¬ ¬ P``, then 
      ``push_neg,`` simplifies it to ``P``. 

      You can also push negations across a hypothesis ``hp : P`` using ``push_neg at hp,``.

  * - ``contrapose!``
    - If the target of the current goal is  ``P → Q``,
      then ``contrapose!,`` changes the target to  ``¬ Q → ¬ P``.

      If the target of the current goal is ``Q`` 
      and one of the hypotheses is ``hp : P``,
      then ``contrapose! hp,`` changes the target to  ``¬ P`` 
      and changes the hypothesis to ``hp : ¬ Q``.

      Mathematically, this is replacing the target by its contrapositive.


And / Or
===================

  * - ``cases``
    - ``cases`` is a general tactic that breaks a complicated term into simpler ones.

      If ``hpq`` is a term of type ``P ∧ Q``, then 
      ``cases hpq with hp hq,`` breaks it into ``hp : P`` and ``hp : Q``.

      If ``hpq`` is a term of type ``P × Q``, then 
      ``cases hpq with hp hq,`` breaks it into ``hp : P`` and ``hp : Q``. 

      If ``fg`` is a term of type ``P ↔ Q``, then 
      ``cases fg with f g,`` breaks it into ``f : P → Q`` and ``g : Q → P``.

      If ``hpq`` is a term of type ``P ∨ Q``, then 
      ``cases hpq with hp hq,`` creates two goals and adds the hypotheses ``hp : P`` and ``hq : Q`` to one each.

  * - ``split``
    - ``split`` is a general tactic that breaks a complicated goal into simpler ones.
    
      If the target of the current goal is ``P ∧ Q``, then 
      ``split,`` breaks up the goal into two goals with targets ``P`` and ``Q``.

      If the target of the current goal is ``P × Q``, then 
      ``split,`` breaks up the goal into two goals with targets ``P`` and ``Q``.

      If the target of the current goal is ``P ↔ Q``, then 
      ``split,`` breaks up the goal into two goals with targets ``P → Q`` and ``Q → P``.

  * - ``left``
    - If the target of the current goal is ``P ∨ Q``, then 
      ``left,`` changes the target to ``P``.
  
  * - ``right``
    - If the target of the current goal is ``P ∨ Q``, then 
      ``right,`` changes the target to ``Q``.

Quantifiers 
==============

  * - ``have``
    - If ``hp`` is a term of type ``∀ x : X, P x`` and 
      ``y`` is a term of type ``y`` then 
      ``have hpy := hp(y)`` creates a hypothesis ``hpy : P y``.

  * - ``intro``
    - If the target of the current goal is ``∀ x : X, P x``, then 
      ``intro x,`` creates a hypothesis ``x : X`` and 
      changes the target to ``P x``.

  * - ``cases``
    - If ``hp`` is a term of type ``∃ x : X, P x``, then 
      ``cases hp with x key,`` breaks it into 
      ``x : X`` and ``key : P x``.

  * - ``use``
    - If the target of the current goal is ``∃ x : X, P x`` 
      and ``y`` is a term of type ``X``, then 
      ``use y,`` changes the target to ``P y`` and tries to close the goal.

Proving "trivial" statements 
=============================

  * - ``norm_num``
    - ``norm_num`` is Lean’s calculator. If the target has a proof that involves *only* numbers and arithmetic operations,
      then ``norm_num`` will close this goal.

      If ``hp : P`` is an assumption then ``norm_num at hp,`` tries to use simplify ``hp`` using basic arithmetic operations.

  * - ``ring`` 
    - ``ring,`` is Lean's symbolic manipulator. 
      If the target has a proof that involves *only* algebraic operations, 
      then ``ring,`` will close the goal.

      If ``hp : P`` is an assumption then ``ring at hp,`` tries to use simplify ``hp`` using basic algebraic operations.

  * - ``linarith`` 
    - ``linarith,`` is Lean's inequality solver.
  
  * - ``simp`` 
    - ``simp,`` is a very complex tactic that tries to use theorems from the mathlib library to close the goal. 
      You should only ever use ``simp,`` to *close a goal* because its behavior changes as more theorems get added to the library.


Equality 
===========

.. list-table:: 
  :widths: 10 90

  * - ``refl``
    - If the current goal is of the form ``X = X`` or ``P ↔ P``, then
      ``refl`` will finish the proof. As long as both sides are defined to be equal,
      this will work. For example, it will work with the goal ``3 = 2 + 1`` because
      *by definition* the number 3 is defined to be 2 plus one.

      Mathematically, this says "check that both sides are qual *by definition*".
  * - ``rw``
    - If ``f`` is a term of type ``P = Q`` (or ``P ↔ Q``), then 

      ``rw f,`` searches for ``P`` in the target and replaces it with ``Q``.

      ``rw ←f,`` searches for ``Q`` in the target and replaces it with ``P``.
      
      If additionally, ``hr : R`` is a hypothesis, then 

      ``rw f at hr,`` searches for ``P`` in the expression ``R`` and replaces it with ``Q``.

      ``rw ←f at hr,`` searches for ``Q`` in the expression ``R`` and replaces it with ``P``.

      Mathematically, this is saying because ``P = Q``, we can replace ``P`` with ``Q`` (or the other way around).
